# Attitudes-Towards-Science-
Files for project "Attitudes towards science" with Jan Woike (MPI Berlin) and Klaus Oberauer, June 2018 - March 2020.

The \_paper directory contains the LaTex source file (socDarw[xxx].Rnw) that can be compiled and will knit the analysis into the text. All input data are in the \_input directory, all R source code is in \_sourceR, and the remaining two directories contain figures and intermediate LaTeX files that are generated during analysis.

All files are accessed via relative paths, so if this collection of directories is downloaded, LaTeX compilation from within \_paper should proceed automatically irrespective of where all directories are located.
