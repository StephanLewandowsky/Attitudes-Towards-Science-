Here
we
are
concerned
only
with
attitudes
towards
scientific
issues,
as
revealed
in
surveys.
We
are
not
concerned
with
laboratory
experiments
involving
synthetic
stimuli,
which
have
often
shown
ideological
symmetry
in
people's
reliance
on
cognitive
shortcuts
\cite

Nothwithstanding
the
ostensibly
evolutionary
constraints
on
mate
choice
illustrated
by
\citeA
{Buss89},
subsequent
research
has
shown
that
the
preferences
(e.g.,
for
men
who
``provide''
for
women)
are
actually
related
to
nations'
gender
parity
\cite
{Zentner12}.

\cite
{Everett13}
reported
a
two-factor
solution
for
his
scale
and
the
difficulties
of
fitting
a
unidimensional
model
are
thus
not
unexpected.
However,
the
correlational
pattern
observed
here
differed
from
that
reported
by
Everett.
