Core beliefs are shown in white (liberals) and black (conservatives) to reflect their opposing polarity. Because core beliefs are thought to be inviolable they are connected by chains. Potential explanatory variables for gender differences are shown in gray. Arrows represent presumed conflict between constructs, support, or neutrality. }}{54}%

Each histogram shows the distribution across subjects of the composite score. Table\nobreakspace {}1\hbox {} provides an overview of the items for each construct. All items were accompanied by a 7-point response scale ranging from ``Strongly agree'' (coded as 7 for analysis) to ``Strongly disagree'' (1) with ``Neither agree nor disagree'' (4) at the midpoint. }}{56}%

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {6}{\ignorespaces Relationship between the three gender-related constructs and acceptance of evolution. Liberals are shown on the left and conservatives on the right (median split of socio-political conservatism construct). The top panels show acceptance of evolution (represented by color of plotting symbols) and people's responses to the constructs probing the origin of gender differences. The bottom panels show belief in gender equality (represented by color of plotting symbols) and people's responses to the two constructs probing evolution generally (ordinate) and that men and women evolved differently (abscissa). Composite scores are used for all constructs. Dashed horizontal and vertical lines represent marginal means. Points are randomly jittered to reduce over-printing.}}{59}%
