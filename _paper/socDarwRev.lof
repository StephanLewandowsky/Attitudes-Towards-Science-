Potential explanatory variables for gender differences are shown in gray. Arrows represent presumed conflict between constructs, support, or neutrality. }}{56}%

Participants with liberal political views are shown on the left and conservatives on the right (median split). The top panels show acceptance of evolution (represented by color of plotting symbols) and people's responses to the constructs probing the origin of gender differences. The bottom panels show belief in gender equality (represented by color of plotting symbols) and people's responses to the constructs probing the origin of gender differences. Composite scores are used for all constructs. Points are jittered to reduce over-printing.}}{61}%
